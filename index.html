      <p>The eligibility of a location for the UCEF funding stream was determined using the urban rural classification of Census Output Areas (COA) in England, as specified by the Office of National Statistics Postcode Directory (ONSPD). The 2011 rural-urban classification of output areas is a revised version a previous classification produced after the 2001 Census. Output areas are treated as ‘urban’ if they were allocated to a 2011 built-up area with a population of 10,000 or more. The urban domain is then further sub-divided into three broad morphological types based on the predominant settlement component. As with the previous version of the classification, the remaining ‘rural’ output areas are grouped into three broad morphological types based on the predominant settlement component. The classification also categorises output areas based on context – i.e. whether the wider surrounding area of a given output area is sparsely populated or less sparsely populated.<p>
	
      <p>In addition to this, there is also an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-rural-urban-classification">urban rural classification for local authorities</a>.  The LA Classification is a ‘spectrum’, or graded system and is based on settlement type as defined by the rural/urban definition. The two classifications that qualify an area as rural are:<p>

	<dl>
	  <dt>rural-50</dt>
	  <dd>districts with at least 50 percent but less than 80 percent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns</dd>
	  <dt>rural-80</dt>
	  <dd>districts with at least 80 percent of their population in rural settlements and larger market towns.</dd>
	</dl>
	
      <p>The local authority classification was used as the main identifier of rural area; areas that are not eligible for the UCEF funding stream. However, any COAs within these rural areas that are classified as urban in the ONSPD database may be eligible for UCEF funding stream. These have been labelled accordingly and potential applicants should consider applying to the UCEF.</p>
