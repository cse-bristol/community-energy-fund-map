# Open Data Map

A prototype map to illustrate what we could do for the Open Data and STEEP projects.

## Goals
 * Really easy to use.
 * Draw LSOAs/Government Office Regions/Postcodes or combinations of those on a map.
 * Store some data on these regions in a simple name -> number format.
 * Execute some functions on that data and colour regions accordingly.

## Not-Goals
We don't care about complex GIS queries (route / area calculations).

## Technology
We plan to display the map in D3 using vector tiles.

We want to try to push a lot of the work out to the client side (that is, in the user's browser).
